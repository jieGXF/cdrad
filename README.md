The repository serves as the official implementation of the paper titled "Interpretable Multimodality-Radiomics-Based Machine Learning Model Predicts the Tumour Accumulation of Nanomedicines". This prediction is characterized by offering a non-invasive and effective method to aid in patient stratification based on tumour nanomedicine accumulation. This study underscores the potential of utilizing radiomics models, which integrate standard-of-care medical imaging with artificial intelligence, to accurately predict nanomedicine accumulation within tumours. The procedure is illustrated by the figure above.
